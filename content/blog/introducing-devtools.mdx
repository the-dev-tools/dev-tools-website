# Introducing DevTools

We're excited to announce **DevTools**, a local-first API testing and flow automation tool. DevTools helps you ship reliable APIs with exportable YAML and a workflow that respects your team's velocity.

## Why Local-First?

Your API testing data is sensitive. DevTools keeps everything on your machine:

- **No cloud dependency**: Everything runs locally
- **No telemetry**: Your data stays private
- **Git-reviewable**: YAML flows are text files you can commit

## How It Works

The flow from traffic to tests takes minutes:

1. **Import HAR**: Record browser traffic and import the HAR file
2. **Generate Flow**: DevTools automatically creates a flow tree with variable mapping
3. **Export YAML**: Save flows as reviewable text files
4. **Run in CI**: Execute with the Go-based CLI runner

### Example Flow

```yaml
flows:
  - name: AuthFlow
    steps:
      - request:
          name: Login
          method: POST
          url: '{{BASE_URL}}/auth/login'
          body:
            email: "test@example.com"
            password: "secret"
      - request:
          name: GetProfile
          method: GET
          url: '{{BASE_URL}}/me'
          headers:
            authorization: "Bearer {{ Login.response.body.token }}"
```

## Key Features

- **HAR → Flow Tree**: Import browser traffic and get a visual flow graph
- **Auto Variable Mapping**: Tokens/IDs extracted automatically
- **YAML Export**: Flows as text files for PR review
- **Go-Fast Runner**: Parallel execution with multithreaded Go engine
- **CI Integration**: JUnit/JSON reports and deterministic exit codes

## What's Next?

We're working on:

- GraphQL and gRPC support
- Enhanced dataset management
- Optional team features (SSO, policies)

Try DevTools today and see how local-first API testing can transform your workflow.
