# Writing docs

Thanks for helping improve the docs. This page is a stub — feel free to expand it or open a PR with your changes.

Where to start
- Add new pages under the appropriate section (Start here / How‑to / Reference / Concepts / Cookbook)
- Keep URLs stable; if moving pages, add a redirect at the server (Caddy)

Local dev
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Style
- Prefer concrete examples over long prose
- Keep headings scannable; one concept per page
- Use code blocks for commands, YAML, and CI snippets
