# Writing Docs

Nextra supports Markdown and MDX. Start with Markdown; add small React snippets only when it adds clarity.

## Headings and TOC

- Use one `#` per page for the title.
- Use `##` and `###` for sections; they show up in the right-hand table of contents.

## Callouts

> Tip: Use blockquotes for simple notes.

For richer callouts, Nextra provides a `<Callout>` component:

```mdx
<Callout type="info">Information callout.</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">Be careful here.</Callout>
```

## Tabs

Use headings or separate pages for alternative flows. If you prefer tabs, you can bring your own small component later.

## Linking

- Link to other pages with absolute paths: `[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)`
- External links open in a new tab by default in this theme.

## Organizing pages

- Create folders under `pages/docs/` and use `_meta.json` files to control titles and ordering.
- Keep page names kebab-cased; titles come from `_meta.json`.
